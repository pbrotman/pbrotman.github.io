## Comments

Feel free to change color tints to achieve lighter/darker versions of colors in the theme.

Main colors are more pure, tend to pop more (even if adjusted to an equally light tint). Light colors are more faded than their main counterparts.

Not an expert on color theory. Will update as I learn more :).
